A browser extension to help you have LLMs summarize content

## Description
The Extension Name is a Chrome-based extension that utilizes the power of Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude to summarize content from YouTube videos, Twitter tweets, and webpages. With this extension, users can quickly get concise summaries of lengthy content, making it easier to grasp the main points without spending excessive time on each piece of content.

## Features
**YouTube Video Summarization:** The extension allows users to summarize YouTube videos, enabling them to get a quick overview of the video's main points and save time.

**Twitter Tweet Summarization:** Users can summarize tweets from Twitter, which is especially beneficial when trying to understand the essence of a lengthy thread or series of tweets.

**Webpage Content Summarization:** The extension also provides the ability to summarize the content of webpages, allowing users to extract key information from articles, blog posts, and other text-based content.

## How It Works
The extension consists of multiple data extraction panels, each tailored to specific sources such as YouTube videos, Twitter tweet lists, threads, and webpage textual content. Users can utilize these panels to extract textual data from the selected sources. Once the data is extracted, the extension opens the corresponding Language Model (LLM) webpage and inserts the extracted data as input into the LLM web application. The extension then submits the data for processing by the LLM. After processing the content, the LLM webpage displays concise summaries to the user. These summaries are generated by the LLMs, focusing on the most relevant and significant information extracted from the provided data.

## Installation
To install the extension from the source code, please follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You must have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Usage 

## Limitations
The extension relies on web applications associated with related Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Claude webpages. However, it is essential to note that if these web applications are inaccessible or down, the extension will not function properly. Also APIs of those LLMs cannot be used.

The extension is designed to extract textual data exclusively from sources that have been integrated into its support system. If a particular source is not supported, the extension's functionality will be limited to the textual data currently visible on the webpage screen.

In the case of ChatGPT, if the textual content exceeds the token limit, the extension will truncate the data into smaller chunks. Each chunk will then be fed to ChatGPT separately. However, it's important to note that this truncation process can lead to a reduction in the accuracy and consistency of the generated summaries.On the other hand, for Claude, the extension does not perform any data truncation. The entire textual content is processed without any chunking, ensuring that the accuracy and consistency of the summaries are maintained.

it's important to note that the generated summaries are based on models' understanding of the text and may not always capture the complete context or nuances. Therefore, it's recommended to use the summaries as a starting point for understanding the content and, if necessary, refer to the original sources for more comprehensive information.
